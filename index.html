            <p>Hi there! My name is Justin Choy and I am a student at 
                 UC Berkely Extension where I am currently learning how to code!</p>
            <p> I was born on January 16 1999 in California where I have lived my entire life.</p>
             <p> I graduated from Saint Mary's College of California
                    in 2021 during COVID. My Major is in history but I also like politics,
                    fun books, and video games. The dream job I want to do is video game development to make fun games for eveyone!
                    My favorite game series is Pokemon!
