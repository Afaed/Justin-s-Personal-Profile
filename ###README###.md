# Process #

For the project I made a to do list (as featured below) to help construct my thoughts and lay out a plan to do the work. I borrowed a ton of code from both Run-Buddy and Horiseon WEb Development. As they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it!

For the glow ups and pictures, I just took stuff I liked and ussed it as a substitute for the Selected Works page. I actually learened how Pseudo classes work and what a wrapper class is for said pseudo classes!

Most importnatly, I deeply thank the people at slackbot for iving me direction and answers for my problems using the pseudo classes which sped up development time.

I also learned how flex categories worked which also helped make the website a lot better and more compact. 


## To Do ##
[x] Find a Picture of me! Justin Choy.
[x] Figure out how to align the text so that way it will be right next to the place holder image.
[x] Add borders and text colors to give everything more character.
    Achieve this by looking at Run-Buddy2's bordr's, margins and images.
[x] Figure out how we can use flex boxes to make the website more     compact.
[x] Find some form of selected works I guess?
[x] Find a Good website to model
[x] Flesh out readme some more.
    [x] Reasearch popular readmes.
    [x] Write a dev process.
    [x] Write where I got my photos.

# Challenges #

Again I think the hardest part of the project was finding the time to do it than the individual elements. I already had a strong skeleton set up the week before becuase it would save me about an hour to build a ewebsite from scratch.

That being said, the gray box featured to the right of the About me section is supposed to be a picture of me but for some reason it won't let me link a picture of myself no matter how many times I wrote/rewrote the directory.

Finally, the pseudo classes while tricky did end up being a very fun part of the project.

Can't wait to add actual projects into the website throughout the course
